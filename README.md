# Launch Bucknell Reader 2.0

The 2.0 version of the Android Bucknell Reader app. The app reads in news from all Bucknell media sources such as Bucknellian and CampusVinyl, and delivers it in a user-friendly and customizable way. The app will support push notifications when news arrives. Later on it will also support music streaming from WVBU.

## Why 2.0?

This summer I accidentally wiped out all data from my laptop, including the repository of the Bucknell Reader app. Though the code of the app could be easily recovered from Github, I found it really hard to manually add the dependencies back because some libraries the app was using had been changed and I was not able to find the old versions anymore. So I thought if I was having trouble cloning the repo, other people who want to contribute would too. Therefore, I decided to create a new app using Graddle, an Android package-managment tool to automate the building, testing, publishing, deployment processes, so people don't need to manually manage the packages anymore after they clone the project. Also since I got more experienced with the original version, I will be able to implement better designs and write better code for this new version. 

## How about Launch?

Launch is an organization at Bucknell University to promote innovations and entrepreneurship. This app is funded by and is developed for Launch.
